# gopack
The original https://github.com/gobuild/gopack no longer works with broken
dependencies, and the gobuild.io it integrated with no longer exists. However,
this is still useful to easily build and zip a project, so this fork allows
for that.

## Features
1. Create `.gopack.yml` config file
2. Build and package build into zip

## Install
	go install github.com/sb10/gopack@latest

## Usage
	$ gopack init
	# create .gopack.yml config file

	$ gopack pack
	# build go code and package README.md LICENSE ... to a zip file
	[golang-sh]$ bash -c go get -v
	[golang-sh]$ bash -c go install
